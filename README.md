# AngularProject

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.6. For now there is only one component inside this application and this component is made of Vue. By using vue-custom-element as a wrapper outside of this Vue component. Now it allows us to use vue components directly inside Angular. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
